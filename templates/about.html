                    Sequential Animation of Phylogenetic Trees Analysing sequences of phylogenetic trees is not an easy
                    task. Especially the differences between neighbouring trees might be important. Such sequences of
                    trees
                    could be generated reconstructing trees for sliding windows along genomic alignments, e.g., to
                    detect
                    recombination events. Another source might be the sequence of trees found during a tree search
                    during
                    phylogenetic analysis. After obtaining such a sequence of trees it tedious to manually analyse
                    neighbouring pairs of trees and to detect where major transitions, changes or recombination events
                    occurred. The main project focus is to build a tool for dynamic visualisation of phylogenetic trees
                    like
                    a media player, which enables browsing dynamically through a sequence of trees, helping the human
                    eye to
                    catch changes between trees with the same leaves but changing hierarchies. Because it is hard to see
                    differences between two trees ways must be found to highlight changes in the tree topologies in a
                    way
                    that the user can easily recognise the major changes. Without a useful visual transition using
                    intermediates between neighbouring tree, it is hard to comprehend the differences between two trees
                    because the bare eye has problems to identify them. By adding coloration, it will be much easier for
                    the
                    user the get an idea of what rearrangements happen. The combination of colourisation and by the
                    intermediate steps, it is easier for the eyes to see clear differences along transitions. The
                    following
                    two properties should have been achieved: First it should be easy to use and secondly visualisations
                    should be high fidelity. These two criteria should be considered for choosing the technical
                    foundation.
                    By building the tool as a browser application it is more accessible to the scientific community,
                    especially experimentalists with limited computational resources. By considering the tool to be a
                    browser application, also obstacles like installation problems are disappearing. Also, an important
                    requirement for the tool was having high animation quality. What is meant by high fidelity is that
                    the
                    animations should be fluid and have a continuous trajectory. Secondly the resolution of the graphic
                    should be high enough, to be able to track small shifts in the trees. The criteria of platform
                    independence and animation quality are fulfilled by the technology of SVGs (Scalable Vector
                    Graphics).
                    The current most recommended framework based on web technologies for working with SVGs is D3. The
                    tool
                    will be tested by analysing tree trajectories which are generated by simulated and real data.
